					<p>Welcome to the online home of OJBK FM, a temporary outdoor community radio station broadcasting live from the intersection of Malcolm X Boulevard and Fulton Street in Bed-Stuy&#45;&#45;in the back of a pink 1959 Cadillac Coup de Ville&#45;&#45;and produced by artist collective Otabenga Jones & Associates and the Central Brooklyn Jazz Consortium. Broadcasts pay tribute to legendary Bed-Stuy institution &#34;The East,&#34; (1969-1985), an educational, political and cultural hub with Black Nationalist and Pan-Africanist directives. The Cadillac pays homage to the 1990 album cover To the East, Blackwards by Brooklyn Hip Hop legends X Clan. Daily programming features live musical mixes of rediscovered vinyl, segments on Black political histories, community dialogues, improvisational jazz performances, artist interviews, and experimental sound.</p>
