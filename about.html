	<div class ="about"><p>Artist collective Otabenga Jones & Associates is collaborating with the Central Brooklyn Jazz Consortium to produce a temporary outdoor radio station that will broadcast live from the back of a pink 1959 Cadillac Coupe de Ville. Broadcasts will pay tribute to former Bed&#45;Stuy cultural center &#34;The East,&#34; founded in 1969 as a hub for creating cultural awareness around the Black Nationalism and pan-Africanist movements.</p></div>
